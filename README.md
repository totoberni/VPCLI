# Financial Strategist CLI

## 1. Project Overview

This command-line interface (CLI) is the user-facing application for the "Oxygen-Analytics" predictive engine. The primary goal of the engine is to provide sophisticated, data-driven investment strategies for a portfolio of tech stocks (Apple, NVIDIA, Google). It leverages time-series analysis and machine learning to analyze the impact of financial sentiment, derived from SEC filings, on future stock performance.

This tool provides a hybrid analysis, offering two distinct types of strategic recommendations based on the user's selected investment horizon.

## 2. System Architecture: A Hybrid Approach

The entire system is composed of two distinct components that work in tandem:

#### **A. The Offline Training & Analysis Pipeline** (`AnalystSentimentEDA.ipynb`)

This Jupyter Notebook is where all the computationally intensive work is performed. Its responsibilities include:
- Ingesting and cleaning raw sentiment and stock price data.
- Engineering a wide array of multi-horizon features (e.g., `Future_Return_36M`).
- Performing a comprehensive lead-lag correlation analysis to identify the most potent predictive signals.
- **Training and Tuning:** For short-to-medium horizons (1M-36M), it trains an ensemble of `XGBoost` models for each company and horizon, using `Optuna` for exhaustive hyperparameter optimization.
- **Historical Analysis:** For long horizons (48M-84M) where historical data shows deterministic outcomes, it performs a deep statistical analysis instead of training a model.

The final output of this offline pipeline is a set of **data artifacts**—serialized Python objects (`.pkl` files) that contain the "intelligence" of the system.

#### **B. The Live Inference CLI** (This Project)

This CLI tool is a lightweight, fast, and interactive application that **consumes** the data artifacts generated by the offline pipeline. It performs no model training or heavy analysis itself. Its responsibilities are:
- **Live Predictive Simulation:** When a user selects a short-term horizon (e.g., 12M), the CLI loads the appropriate pre-trained `XGBoost` models and runs a **real-time simulation** to generate a rulebook of potential investment actions and their predicted outcomes.
- **Instant Historical Reporting:** When a user selects a long-term horizon (e.g., 48M), the CLI loads the pre-computed historical analysis and instantly displays the most powerful, high-certainty investment scenarios discovered in the historical data.
- **User Interface:** Provides a clean, interactive prompt for users to select their desired company and investment horizon, and displays the results in a polished, readable format.

## 3. Required Assets

For the CLI to function, it requires the following artifacts to be placed in its `assets/` directory. These are the final outputs from the Phase 6 notebook pipeline.

-   **`trained_pipelines.pkl`**: Contains the dictionary of all trained XGBoost model suites.
-   **`historical_certainty_reports.pkl`**: Contains the dictionary of all pre-computed historical analysis DataFrames.
-   **`modeling_datasets.pkl`**: Contains the reference training data (`X_train`) needed to create a baseline for live simulations.
-   **`master_performance_report.html`**: An optional, consolidated HTML report for reviewing model performance.

## 4. Usage (Prototype)

1.  Ensure all dependencies are installed from the `pyproject.toml` file (`pip install .`).

2.  Run the application from the terminal:
    ```bash
    strategy-report
    ```
3.  Follow the interactive prompts to receive a strategic report.
